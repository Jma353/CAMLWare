# CAMLWare

To prepare:

`Python` must be installed because the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` is utilized in the `run` script (running `D3` JavaScript code in a server environment is always the move).

```
opam install oasis deriving d3 yojson
```

### To run

```
./build
./run
```
Open up webpage `localhost:8000` in browser

### To clean up

```
./clean
```
